# Governance-Decentralization-Benchmarks-and-Tracker

### Summary
This repository will contain research related to the following areas:
1. [Dashboard measuring decentralization of voting in Snapshot proposals for Uniswap and other select peer protocols.](https://signalcorps.shinyapps.io/Uniswap_Snapshot/ )
2. Analysis of Uniswap delegation
3. Analysis of on-/off-chain voting within Uniswap Governance

### Methodology
The dashboard analyzes off-chain voting participation and distribution on the the Snapshot governance platform. Voting data is sourced from the [Snapshot GraphQL API](https://docs.snapshot.org/graphql-api); Python script to reproduce data is available at [utils/snapshot_votes.py](https://github.com/Signal-Corps/Governance-Decentralization-Benchmarks-and-Tracker/blob/main/utils/snapshot_votes.py)

A diverse set of metrics and visualizations are presented to examine the degree of decentralization exhibited in various protocols' off-chain governance. R code for the development of Shiny App and calculation of decentralization metrics is forthcoming.
